//Machine Learning
1) Data Cleansing (error in sourcing, storing, retrieving, transformation, pipelining etc)
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (Bell La s)vs. Confirmation Data Analysis 
   5 number summary - sample minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, sample maximum - box plot, stem and leaf diagram
   Summary Sets - Anscombe's Quartet 1973
3) Supervisory Learning (kNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression?, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests)
   Unsupervisory Techniques (Clustering, Factor Analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
4) Normal Distrib, Central Limit Theorem (Th distribution of sum of n identically distributed random variables X approaches a normal distrib as n-> infinity)
        t-test & ANOVA 
    mean, variance, t-test, ANOVA -? assumes data are normally distributed
5)  Other distribs  - Poisson D, Exponential D, Chi-Sq D, Zipf, Yule, Pareto, Binomaial, Multinomial
