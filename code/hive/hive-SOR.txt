-- The schema on read principle allows you to store data into HDFS (Consequently in Hive) without worrying about the underlying structure of the data.
-- At write time, no constraints are enforced if there is a data type violation
-- This allows for multiple schemas to be defined on the same dataset - providing enormous flexibility
-- Making a change is also fairly easy. 

-- Copy person.txt and person2.txt into HDFS /user/cloudera/person.txt and /user/cloudera/person2.txt 

CREATE TABLE person (
	name STRING,
	age  BIGINT
) COMMENT 'Schema on Read Example'
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    STORED AS TEXTFILE;

	
LOAD  DATA  INPATH  '/user/cloudera/person.txt' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE person;

select * from person;

LOAD  DATA  INPATH  '/user/cloudera/person2.txt'  INTO TABLE person;

-- The following statement would return null for those names whose ages are non-integers
select * from person; 



--- Now create another schema this time with age as STRING
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE person2 (
	name STRING,
	age  STRING
) COMMENT 'Schema on Read Example'
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    STORED AS TEXTFILE
	location '/user/hive/warehouse/person'
