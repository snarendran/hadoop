-- The schema on read principle allows you to store data into HDFS (Consequently in Hive) without worrying about the underlying structure of the data.
-- At write time, no constraints are enforced if there is a data type violation
-- This allows for multiple schemas to be defined on the same dataset - providing enormous flexibility
-- Making a change is also fairly easy. 

CREATE TABLE person (
	name STRING,
	age  INT
) COMMENT 'Schema on Read Example'
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    STORED AS TEXTFILE;

--Load person.txt and person2.txt from z:\...data\person\ to HDFS under /user/cloudera/person
	
LOAD  DATA  INPATH  '/user/cloudera/person/person.txt' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE person;
LOAD  DATA  INPATH  '/user/cloudera/person/person2.txt'  INTO TABLE person;    -- Do not overwrite
