-- Partition Example: Employees

-- Download the employee dataset from z:\Data management Dev\....\data\employee\employee.data\employees\employees
-- Load it into HDFS using hue under /user/cloudera/employees

-- Create a staging table and load it... 

drop table employees_stg;

CREATE TABLE employees_stg (
	name STRING, salary FLOAT,  subordinates ARRAY<STRING>,  deductions MAP<STRING, FLOAT>,
	address STRUCT <street:STRING, city:STRING, state:STRING, zip:INT>
)  	ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
	FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\001'
	COLLECTION ITEMS TERMINATED BY '\002'
	MAP KEYS TERMINATED BY '\003'
	LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
	STORED AS TEXTFILE;
	
LOAD  DATA  INPATH  '/user/cloudera/employees/employees.dat' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE employees_stg;

-- Create a partitioned managed table called employees as follows:

CREATE TABLE employees (
	name STRING, salary FLOAT,  subordinates ARRAY<STRING>,  deductions MAP<STRING, FLOAT>,
	address STRUCT<street:STRING, city:STRING, state:STRING, zip:INT>
)  PARTITIONED BY (state STRING)
	ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
	FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\001'
	COLLECTION ITEMS TERMINATED BY '\002'
	MAP KEYS TERMINATED BY '\003'
	LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
	STORED AS TEXTFILE;
	
-- Load the data from staging as following
INSERT into employees PARTITION (state) select  name,salary,subordinates,deductions,address,address.state from employees_stg ;

-- Notice how data is partitioned by state
